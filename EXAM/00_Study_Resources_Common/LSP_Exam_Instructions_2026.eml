Dear students!

1/ The exam will take place at Karlovo n=C3=A1m=C4=9Bst=C3=AD, but in build=
ing A, in classroom KN-A-310 on January 13, 2026.=20
Immediately after the main reception desk, go up the stairs to the 3rd floo=
r, and 310 is on the right. We have a time slot from 10:00 to 11:30, so we =
must start and finish exactly on time. Please arrive a little early.

2/ The exam contains eight easy questions, but from all lectures, including=
 the last two.

3/ If you look at previous exams, you will find that four types of examples=
 are repeated regularly, just with different values each time. All examples=
 are described in SEL (Solved Examples from LSP Written Tests), along with =
sample solutions. See Moodle at the beginning of the "Self-study opportunit=
ies" section for the PDF "Solved Examples from LSP Written Tests".

a) Signed and Unsigned value of bit number: SEL pg. 2 and 3

b) The same logic functions:  SEL from 4 to 7 - You must solve using Karnau=
gh maps, not by substituting values, which is a path to hell.=20

c+d) Simulations of a circuit with NAND and NOR RS-latch  + its conversion =
to equations and their decomposition using Shannon expansion. SEL 11 to 14 =
with a solved example on page 12

4/ We are missing one lecture, so on Monday, January 12, 2026, i.e., the da=
y before the exam, I will be present at Karlovo n=C3=A1m=C4=9Bst=C3=AD in m=
y office that is near the classroom KN-E-23 from 14:30 to 19:00. I will com=
e to the classroom upon request by your email for submitting assignments or=
 consultations. Of course, I will also correct all tasks uploaded to DCENET=
 on Monday.

Regards Richard =C5=A0usta

P.S. This year, jump predictors and cache memory were covered very briefly.=
 Thus, on the written exams, there will be no questions on calculating erro=
neous predictions and cache misses, i.e., SEL 17 and beyond.=20
However, you may encounter a question about the processor pipelines.
